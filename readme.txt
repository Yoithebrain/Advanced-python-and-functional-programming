# Uge 4 - Niveau 2


## Description
This project makes use of multiprocessing to process a really big file. It demonstrates the concepts for how this can be done, even if there are still bottlenecks present within the code.
Some of which have been a pain to figure out how to solve.

Make use of the Faker file to generate a data file thats even bigger than the big file inside files. The one I have been using ran around 8 million lines. This file is included in the zip*

* Maybe if Moodle can handle the zip size..

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:
pip install faker==3.0.1
pip install matplotlib

## Cheers
